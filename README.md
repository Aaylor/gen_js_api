gen_js_api: generate OCaml bindings for Javascript libraries
============================================================

Overview
--------

gen_js_api aims at simplifying the creation of OCaml bindings for
Javascript libraries, to be used with the [js_of_ocaml
compiler](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml).  It is based on the
following ideas:

 - Authors of bindings write OCaml signatures for Javascript libraries
   and the tool generates automatically the actual binding code.

 - The generated binding code takes care of translating values between
   OCaml and Javascript.

 - All syntactic processing is done by authors of bindings: the client
   code looks is normal OCaml code and does not depend on custom
   syntax nor on JS-specific types.


gen_js_api can be used in two complementary ways:

  - [Generating .ml implementations from annotated .mli interfaces](IMPLGEN.md),
    in order to create the code for stub libraries.

  - As a [ppx preprocessor on implementations](PPX.md) to define local
    bindings.


Examples
--------

The repository contains some examples of OCaml bindings to Javascript
libraries created with gen_js_api:

 - Very partial [ bindings to jQuery](examples/jquery.mli), with
   some [example client code](examples/test_jquery.ml).

 - Partial [bindings to Javascript strings and
   regexps](examples/js_str.mli), with some [example client
   code](examples/test_js_str.ml).

 - Partial [bindings to Javascript dates](examples/js_date.mli), with
   some [example client code](examples/test_js_date.ml).
